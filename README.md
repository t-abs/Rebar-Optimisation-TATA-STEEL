# Rebar-Optimisation-TATA-STEEL
Main aim is the minimal optimisation of rods and generate the various cutting patterns that produces minimal wastage(by using Column Generation Technique/Knapsack problem)
Various Approaches are there to solve the problem.This includes the column generation method,Knapsack approach and Genetic Algorithm.Main aim lies in the optimisation patterns.

The 1D Cutting Stock Problem is an example of Optimisation problem and is used in manufacturing industries.Each rods have specific demands of specific lengths along with the arbitary(inventory values) of demands .The goal is to determine the cutting patterns by various approaches and determine the demands upto which it can be fulfilled and
which inventory rods to be used first and in what manner.
The first part of code snippet contains basic rebar optimisation of Standard 12m Rebar Rod 
The second part of Project contains the Rebar Optimisation using Arbitary and Inventory Data.
(Includes Knapsack and Column Generation Linear Programming echniques and Distribution using Greedy Approach)
(Includes Distribution of Demands using Greedy Algorithm)
